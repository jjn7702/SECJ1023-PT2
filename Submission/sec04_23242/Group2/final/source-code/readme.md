# SECTION A
Our project focuses on the development of a Personal Organiser system, which serves as a centralised platform for users to manage their reminders and events efficiently. Similar to popular tools like Google Keep, our Personal Organiser provides users the ability to create a timeline which lets the user keep track of any upcoming events.

The main objective of the system is to help the user to organise their activities and events in a more structured and easier to access way. The user can input their future events or activities into the system and the system will save and display any upcoming activities to act as a reminder for the user on the timeline, almost like a calendar. The system will also ask for the date and time of the events and calculate which event is going to come out first and display it on the front page for the user to see, and the user can further check their other events if they choose to do so. An optional description could also be added to the events, giving more options for the user to set up their events. Furthermore, the system allows for the users to remove or edit the events that they’ve entered into the system previously. When the current time has already passed the date of an event, it would display that the event is happening now and remind the user to attend the event. After approximately an hour after the reminder or the event has gone by, the system will automatically remove the event from the user’s timeline, which means as long as before the one hour mark reaches, the user is still able to edit details about the event that was currently happening. The events that a user enters would also be saved in an external file, so the user can still see back all the previous events that they have entered.
The main output for the system would be the display of events on an ordered basis based on the order that the events were keyed into the system. The most recent upcoming event would be displayed on the front page, and if the user chooses to do so, they can view all the other events they have added by choosing the option to “view timeline”. Once the date for the events have passed, the status of the event will be changed to ‘done’ and the event will be cleared from the system and no longer be shown on the user’s timeline.

The main output for the system would be the display of events on an ordered basis based on the date and time of the events. The most recent upcoming event would be displayed on the front page, and if the user chooses to do so, they can view all the other events they have added by choosing the option to “view all events”. Once the date for the events have passed and the user has changed the status of the event to ‘done’, the event will be cleared from the system and no longer be shown on the event display.
