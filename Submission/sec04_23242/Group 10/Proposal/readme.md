# PROJECT PROPOSAL GROUP 10
## TOPIC: Event Scheduler

# Synopsis and General Idea About The Proposed Topic/System
  Our project focuses on the development of an Event Scheduler system. An event scheduler is a software tool designed to facilitate the organization and management of events, appointments, meetings, tasks, or any other time-based activities. It provides users with a centralized platform to schedule, track, and coordinate various activities, ensuring efficient use of time and resources. Similar to popular tools like Google Calendar, our Event Scheduler provides users with a user-friendly interface to create, edit, emphasize, and track various types of events. By offering a centralized hub for organizing tasks, events, notes, and reminders, the Event Scheduler empowers users to stay on top of their commitments and achieve their goals effectively.

# System Objectives and/or Purpose and What The User Can Achieve/Do in The System
1. To allow users to create, schedule and manage a variety of events, such as meeting, conferences, appointment and so on.
2. To allow users to look over all future events, create reminders and prevent scheduling conflicts using the system's centralized calendar interface.
3. To allow users to easily track RSVPs(a request for response from the invited guests to indicate whether they will attend the event or not), invite participants to events and share crucial information about the event.
4. To allow users to assign tasks related to event planning and execution to team members, monitor progress and ensure they are finished on time.
5. To allow users to get notifications and reminders from the system regarding upcoming events, deadlines and any changes to event details.
6. To allow users to generate reports and analyze event to evaluate their success, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions for future events.

# How to Use The System
1. Users need to log in or register to access the system. New users can create an account with their email address and set up their profile.
2. Users may invite others to the event by entering their email addresses or choosing them from a list of contacts. Email invites will be sent to participants and they can reply directly through the system itself.
3. Users may click the "Create An Event" button and fill up the form with the event data, including the title, date, time, location, description and list of participants to plan a new event.
4. Users will obtain a dashboard with a summary of tasks, future events and current activity when they log in. Users can access many system parts at this point.
5. Users can create and assign tasks related to event planning and execution to team members. They can set deadlines, priority levels and track work progress within the system.
6. Users can generate reports and analyze event data to evaluate their success, identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions for future events. This will prompt the success of events and make informed decisions for future planning.
7. Users can view their events in a calendar format which allows them to see all scheduled events. They can switch between daily, weekly or monthly views for better planning.
8. Users will get notifications and reminders from the system regarding upcoming events, deadlines and any changes to event details by pressing the button of allow notifications from the system.

# What is the report/output that will be generated in the system
1. Event Summary: This report provides an overview of all scheduled events within a specified time frame. It includes details such as event title, date, time, location, description, list of participants and RSVP status.
2. Task progress: This report tracks the progress of tasks related to event planning and execution. It inclueds information such as title, assignmed team member, deadline, priority level and current status. (eg: pending, in progress, completed)
3. Customized report: Users may have specific reporting requirements based on their unique event planning needs. The system allows users to customize reports by selecting relevant parameters, filters and formatting options.
