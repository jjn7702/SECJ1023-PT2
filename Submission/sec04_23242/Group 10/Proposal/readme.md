# PROJECT PROPOSAL GROUP2
## TOPIC: Event Scheduler

# Synopsis and General Idea About The Proposed Topic/System
Our project focuses on the development of an Event Scheduler system. An An event scheduler is a software tool designed to facilitate the organization and management of events, appointments, meetings, tasks, or any other time-based activities. It provides users with a centralized platform to schedule, track, and coordinate various activities, ensuring efficient use of time and resources. Similar to popular tools like Google Calendar, our Personal Organiser provides users with a user-friendly interface to create, edit, emphasize, and track various types of events. By offering a centralized hub for organizing tasks, events, notes, and reminders, the event Scheduler empowers users to stay on top of their commitments and achieve their goals effectively.
