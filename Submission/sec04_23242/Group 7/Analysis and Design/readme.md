# Section A: Flowchart
The flowchart outlines a comprehensive process for the Scholarship Application system, detailing paths for both admin and student users. The process starts by identifying whether the user is an admin or a student. For Admin, they need to input their admin ID and password first. Then, they will be able to choose either to set up a scholarship, review and evaluate students, or proceed to logout the system. To set up the scholarship, Admins need to choose between Pre-University or Degree scholarship. The system will display available scholarships with the option to add, update or view scholarships. In order to add a new scholarship, they must provide the scholarship's name, date for submission, minimum age, and minimum A's for the SPM examination. Additional details are available for the Degree Scholarship, which requires a minimum pre-university CGPA. The second option involves updating the scholarship information, with the Admins selecting which scholarships to update. After that, the system will show the most recent scholarship details, and Admins can proceed to edit the scholarship's details. Admins can select option 3 to view a list of scholarships that has been stored with the details. Back to Admin menu, option 2 is Review and Evaluate option where Admin can see the list of applicants, see their details and update their application status. Then, Admin can choose option 3 to log out from the system.

Under the Student menu, they will have three options available to them which are view scholarship, sign up for new applicants, and login for existing applicants. If they want to view scholarships, the available scholarships will be shown, and they can select any one to view further information about it. For signing up, they must first select whether they are pre-university or degree students. Next, they have to enter all the necessary data, including their email address, password, phone number, complete name, race, religion, IC number, height, weight, gender, name of institute, field of study, start and end dates of their studies, and SPM results. Students pursuing degrees must additionally indicate their highest qualifying CGPA. Applicants who are already registered can choose option 3, which involves providing their password and IC number to log into the system. The system will show three further options: summary of application form, application status, and logout. They can view the application form summary with all of their details for option 1. They could choose option 2 to view the status of the application. Finally, they can select the third option to log out of the system.
