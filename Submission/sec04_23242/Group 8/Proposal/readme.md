## Synopsis
1. The Sleep Cycle Analyzer is a C++ web-based system aimed at analyzing and improving users' sleeping habits.
2. It collects data such as total time in bed, sleep duration, and physiological markers during sleep.
3. Once sufficient data is collected, the system analyzes sleep cycles, including patterns and quality of each stage (light, deep, REM).
4. Suggestions for altering sleep plans, optimizing the sleep environment, or practicing relaxation methods are provided based on the analysis.
5. It offers a straightforward yet effective approach for understanding and improving healthy sleeping habits.

## System Objectives & Purposes
1. Identify sleep stages including falling asleep ,light sleep, deep sleep and REM sleep (Rapid Eye Movement)
2. Identify sleep needs which will ascertain more concisely when, why, what conditions your sleep improves. For example, adjusting temperature or position of sleeping
3. Detect sleep anomalies. For instance, sleep disorders such as insomnia or sleep apnea can be identified earlier

## How to use the system
1. prompt the user to input basic information such as their name and age within the console
2. simulate the start of sleep tracking by prompting the user to input the time they went to bed and the time they woke up then the system will calculate the 
   duration of their sleep
3. after tracking sleep is completed,  our system will display the recorded sleep duration and basic analysis of sleep stages
4. after that, our system will provide recommendations within the console for improving usersâ€™ sleep quality

## Reporting
For the reporting aspect of the Sleep Cycle Analyzer system, several types of reports or outputs can be generated to provide users with insights into their sleep patterns and suggestions for improvement. Here are the reports/outputs: 

1. Sleep Cycle Analysis Report: The user's sleep cycles are broken down in detail in the Sleep Cycle Analysis Report. This includes information on how long each stage of sleep lasts (light, deep, REM, and falling asleep), as well as any disruptions or anomalies that were noticed during the night. It may include graphs or visual representations to illustrate the patterns observed. 

2. Sleep Quality Assessment: Based on variables like sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and the existence of any sleep disturbances (e.g., restless sleep, awakenings), this report assesses the user's overall quality of sleep. It might offer suggestions for enhancing the quality of the user's sleep, like modifying their sleeping environment or engaging in relaxation exercises. 

3. Sleep Trends Analysis: This report tracks changes in the user's sleep patterns over time, allowing them to monitor progress and identify any long-term trends or patterns. It may include comparative data from previous sleep sessions or benchmarks for optimal sleep parameters. 

4. Personalized Sleep Improvement Plan: This report provides personalized suggestions for enhancing sleep routines and habits based on an analysis of the user's sleep data. It might recommend adjustments to lifestyle choices, sleeping environments, or bedtime customs that could improve the quantity and quality of sleep. 

5. Sleep Disorder Detection: The system may produce a report advising additional assessment by a healthcare provider in situations where probable sleep disorders (such as insomnia or sleep apnea) are identified. It might contain details about the symptoms that have been noticed, how frequently they occur, and any possible effects on general health. 

6. Customizable Reporting Options: Depending on their preferences and needs, users may have the option to customize the format and content of their sleep reports. This could include choosing specific metrics to track, setting goals for sleep improvement, or receiving notifications/alerts for significant changes or events detected during sleep.
