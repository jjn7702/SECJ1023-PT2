### Description
  The flowchart begins with requesting the user to choose one of four options: Customer, Admin, Read Me or Exit. When the customer option is selected, the user is required to enter their personal details, including name, phone number and estimated budget. Following this, the customer can choose to either start shopping or exit the system. If they choose to shop, the customer is directed to a menu where they can select from various categories such as vegetables, fruits and meat. Within each category, they can choose specific items and select the desired quantity by packet size and add to their cart. Then, customers have the option to continue shopping or proceed to payment. At the payment stage, the customer enters the amount they are paying. The system checks if the payment is sufficient. If it is, a receipt is displayed showing the total amount paid and a thank-you message. If the payment is insufficient, the customer is prompted to pay the correct amount. If the payment exceeds the total, the system calculates and displays the change. Once the payment process is complete, a final receipt is generated, summarizing the shopping trip, including the budget limit, total spent,  remaining budget and budget status.

  For the Admin option, the user must enter a username and password. Upon successful login, the admin can search for and view customer receipt files. If the "Read Me" option is selected, the system displays a user manual outlining how to add items, enter quantities, make payments, and log in as an admin. The user manual also explains how to exit the system. When the Exit option is chosen, the system terminates.
