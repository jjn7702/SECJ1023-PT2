## SECTION B

- **Encapsulation**
Encapsulation is primarily achieved through the use of private member variables and public member functions.

**Admin Class**
Encapsulation in the Admin class means that its inner workings—like usernames, passcodes, and menu items—are kept private and can only be managed through specific methods provided by the class.
