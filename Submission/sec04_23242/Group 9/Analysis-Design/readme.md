# Section A: Flow Chart
First of all, a user registration page will be displayed. Users must enter their PatientID, full name, password, date of birth (DOB) and gender (M/F). Then, the system will verify the user’s age, if the user’s age is below 13 years old or above 70 years old, a new user named “guardian” is needed to monitor the patient’s medication status and also serve as a human reminder. Hence, the system will display “You need a guardian” to notify the patient and then get the guardian name. Next, the login screen will be displayed. Users have to enter their registered PatientID and password. The system will authenticate the PatientID and password. If the PatientID and password is incorrect, the system will display “Incorrect ID or Password” to notify the user and return to the login page for the user to re-enter the correct PatientID and password. If the PatientID and password is correct, the user successfully login to the medicine scheduler system. <br> 
By default, the system will display the list of current medicine taken by the patient. 3 options will be given. Users can select to (1. Add Medicine, 2. Remove Medicine, 3. Logout and view calendar). By choosing “1”, the user has to enter the medication name, form, dosage and intake frequency. The system will also ask users to enter the starting date and end date, daily frequency and intake time of the medication. By choosing “2”, the user has to enter the medication name that is intended to remove from the medication list displayed. The system will search for the medication by comparing the medication name input with the medication name in the list. If the comparison fails, this indicates that there's a mistake while inputting the medication name or the medication is not in the list, then, “Medication not found” will be displayed and returned to allow the user to re-enter the correct medication name. If the comparison succeeds, all the information of the specified medication will be removed from the medication list, then “Successfully delete [medication name]” will be displayed. The updated medication list will be displayed. By choosing “3”, users get to logout of the system and a report with medication details and schedule will be displayed. If the user has incorrect input while selecting a choice, a message “Invalid choice, choose again will be displayed.” and return to allow the user to re-enter the appropriate choice selected. Lastly, users will be allowed to choose whether or not to exit the system, if the user chooses not to exit the system, the system will return to the default display with the medication list and the choices for the user to take action as explained above. If user choose to exit the system, user are able to successfully exit the system.
