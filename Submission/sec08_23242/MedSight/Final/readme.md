# 1.0 Introduction

Our project Disease Diagnose system is a software application designed to diagnose disease based on  the symptoms entered by the user.  The main aim of this application is to ensure the users can take early precautions to treat their disease. The application will prompt the user to enter as many symptoms as they have and how long they have been sick to ensure accurate and early disease diagnosis. In addition, this system will also recommend to users which medicine they should take to treat the disease and also clinics and physicians according to their locations.

In an era where healthcare is so crucial, the Disease Diagnosis System analyzes user entered symptoms and provides a preliminary diagnosis. Our system not only helps in identifying diseases at an early stage but also provides the user detailed description of their diseases, suggested medicines and nearby clinics information. It is designed to be user-friendly, ensuring that users can easily solve their health issues and also use it to improve their health conditions.

# 2.0 Project Description

The Disease Diagnose System is designed to enhance the healthcare experience by diagnosing diseases based on symptoms and illness duration entered by the users. Once symptoms are entered, the system will analyze the data to diagnose the possible disease the user is suffering from. In addition to diagnosing the disease, the system provides several key features:

+ Suggested Medicines:  The system suggests the user appropriate medications based on the diagnosed disease.

+ Clinic Referrals: There are some serious diseases which  require professional medical attention. And so our system will ask the user to enter their current location, it will recommend visiting a clinic nearby with the clinicâ€™s name, location, availability and contact details.

+ Early Precautions: Users can take early precautions for their disease with the help of our system before confirming the diagnosis with doctors or healthcare professionals.
