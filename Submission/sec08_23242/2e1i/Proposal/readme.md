## Synopsis and General Idea 📖

These days, the prevalence of unhealthy eating habits, fueled by a reliance on junk food and snacks, has contributed to many health issues, including obesity and related diseases. Recognizing the importance of maintaining a balanced diet and an active lifestyle, we aim to introduce a nutrition tracker system to address this growing concern.

The **nutrition tracking system** aims to provide users with a comprehensive platform to **monitor their dietary intake**, set nutrition goals, and receive personalized recommendations. By integrating user-friendly interfaces and advanced data analysis, the system empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their health and wellness.

## Objectives and Purposes 🎯
- Enable users to set personalized health goals based on factors such as age, weight, gender, and activity level.

- Track daily food intake, including calories, macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins) and fiber.

- Provide real-time feedback on users' progress towards their nutrition goals.

- Offer personalized recommendations from nutritionists to optimize dietary habits and improve overall well-being.



## How to use the system 🛠️
- **User Registration/Login:** New users can sign up for an account by providing basic information such as age and gender. Existing users can log in with their credentials.

- **Profile Setup:** Users set up their profiles by entering relevant details such as activity level. 

- **Goal Setting:** The system provides a recommended daily calorie budget based on users’ individual information. Users also have the option to set personalized nutrition goals, such as calorie intake   targets. 

- **Daily Tracking:**
  
Food Intake: Users categorize their daily food intake into distinct meal categories such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack. They log their consumption by searching for items in the system's database or manually entering nutritional information. They track calories, macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins), and fiber consumed throughout the day.

Physical Activity: Users also track their daily calories burned. This includes exercises, workouts, or any other physical movements that contribute to their energy expenditure. Users have the option to directly input the calories burnt through physical activity.


- **Feedback and Recommendations:** The system compares users’ nutritional intake against personalized targets thereby generating real-time overview on users' progress towards their nutrition goals. Additionally, users are offered personalized recommendations from nutritionists based on users’ diet patterns.
