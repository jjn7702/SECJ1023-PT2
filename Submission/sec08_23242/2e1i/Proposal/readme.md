## Synopsis and General Idea üìñ

These days, the prevalence of unhealthy eating habits, fueled by a reliance on junk food and snacks, has contributed to many health issues, including obesity and related diseases. Recognizing the importance of maintaining a balanced diet and an active lifestyle, we aim to introduce a nutrition tracker system to address this growing concern.

The **nutrition tracking system** aims to provide users with a comprehensive platform to **monitor their dietary intake**, set nutrition goals, and receive personalized recommendations. By integrating user-friendly interfaces and advanced data analysis, the system empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their health and wellness.

## Objectives and Purposes üéØ
- Enable users to set personalized health goals based on factors such as age, weight,
gender, and activity level
- Track daily food intake, including calories, macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins)
and fiber
- Provide a tracking report based on the user‚Äôs progress towards their calories intake and
health condition.
- Offer personalized feedback from nutritionists to optimize dietary habits and improve
overall well-being.



## How to use the system üõ†Ô∏è
- **User Registration/Login:**  The system allow two type of users:
  - *Regular users* :      New users can sign up by providing basic information such as age and gender. Existing users can log in with their credentials.
  - *Nutritionist* : Nutritionists can register for specialized accounts that can access additional functionalities. Existing nutritionists can log in with their credentials to provide guidance to regular users.


- **Profile Setup:** Users set up their profiles by entering relevant details such as height, weight, and activity level. The system utilizes this information to determine suggested nutrition goals tailored to users‚Äô lifestyle.


- **Goal Setting:** The system provides a recommended daily calorie budget based on users‚Äô individual information. Users also have the option to set personalized nutrition goals, such as calorie intake   targets. 

- **Daily Tracking:**
  
  - *Food Intake*       : Users categorize their daily food intake into distinct meal categories such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack. They log their consumption by searching for items in the system's database or manually entering nutritional information. They track calories, macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins), and fiber consumed throughout the day.

  - *Physical Activity* : Users also track their daily calories burned. This includes exercises, workouts, or any other physical movements that contribute to their energy expenditure. Users have the option to directly input the calories burnt through physical activity.


- **Feedback from nutritionist :** The system compares users‚Äô nutritional intake against personalized targets thereby generating real-time overview on users' progress towards
their nutrition goals. Additionally, users are offered personalized feedback from nutritionists based on users‚Äô diet patterns.


## Reporting üñ•Ô∏è
- **Daily Summary:** Users receive a daily summary of their food intake including nutrition intake and calories burnt.

- **Nutritionist feedback:** Nutritionists can review users' data and provide tailored feedback
for achieving optimal health and wellness.
