<h3>About the flowchart:-
</h3>
<h4>The main process of the system begins with the Main Menu, where users can choose to manage their profiles or search for food items. Users can create a new profile by providing personal details such as name, email, age range, and selecting allergens from a pre-populated list. If an existing profile is chosen, the system retrieves the stored information for the user to review or update.
Once a profile is set up, users can perform food searches. They can either use the Search Bar to type in specific food items or browse through categorized lists of foods. The system checks the ingredients of the selected food against the user's allergy profile to determine if it is safe to consume. If the food contains allergens, the system alerts the user, specifying the allergens found. If no allergens are detected, the system confirms the food is safe.

The system also provides detailed reporting based on search results, informing users whether a food is "Safe to Consume" or "Contains Allergens" along with specifics. Additionally, users can search by allergen to find foods that contain or are free from the allergen and those that may pose a cross-contamination risk. Throughout the process, users can update their profiles to ensure accurate and personalized allergy checks, continually enhancing their experience and safety
