- `Inventory`
- `Sales`
- `Food`
- `Toy`
- `Medicine`

- `string material`

#### Public Methods:
- `Toy(string id, string name, int quantity, double price, string expired, string material, Supplier sup)` - Constructor to initialize the attributes.
- `string getExpired()` - Accessor to get expiry date.
- `string getMaterial()` - Accessor to get the material of toys.
- `string getDetails()` - Method to get the details of the toy item.

#### 8. Medicine

- `string getDescription()` - Accessor to get the description.
- `string getDetails()` - Method to get the details of the other item.

#### 10. Expired
#### Private Attributes:
- `string expired`
- 
#### Public Methods:
- `Expired(string expired)` - Constructor to initialize `expired`.
- `string getExpired()` - Accessor to get expiry date.
- 
#### Class Relation:

#### Association
- Aggregation
  
 1.Inventory and Food
 
Inventory and Food will have an aggregation relationship. The Inventory class holds a pointer to a Food object.  The Food object is created outside the Inventory and is passed to it, showing a "has-a" relationship. Food can exist independently.If the Inventory object is destroyed, the Food object will not be destroyed.

2.Inventory and Toy

Inventory and Toy will have an aggregation relationship. The Inventory class holds a pointer to a Toy object.  The Toy object is created outside the Inventory and is passed to it, showing a "has-a" relationship.Toy can exist independently. If the Inventory object is destroyed, the Toy object will not be destroyed.

3.Inventory and Medicine

Inventory and Medicine will have an aggregation relationship. The Inventory class holds a pointer to a Medicine object. The Medicine object is created outside the Inventory and is passed to it, showing a "has-a" relationship.Medicine can exist independently. f the Inventory object is destroyed, the Medicine object will not be destroyed.

4.Inventory and Other

Inventory and Other will have an aggregation relationship.The Inventory class holds a pointer to a Other object. The Other object is created outside the Inventory and is passed to it, showing a "has-a" relationship. Other can exist independently.If the Inventory object is destroyed, the Other object will not be destroyed.

5.Sales and Item

Sales and Item will have an aggregation relationship.The Sales class holds a pointer to a Item object. The Item object is created outside the Sales and is passed to it, showing a "has-a" relationship. Other can exist independently.If the Sales object is destroyed, the Item object will not be destroyed.

6.SupplierManager and Supplier

SupplierManager and Supplier will have an aggregation relationship.The SupplierManager class holds a pointer to a Supplier object. The Supplier object is created outside the SupplierManager and is passed to it, showing a "has-a" relationship. Other can exist independently.If the SupplierManager object is destroyed, the Supplier object will not be destroyed.

- Composition
  
 1.Item and Supplier
 
  Item and Supplier have an composition relationship.Both of them are highly dependent on 
  each other,if the Item is destroyed then the Supplier also destroyed and vice versa.
  
  2.Expired and Food
  
  Expired and Food have an composition relationship.Both of them are highly dependent 
  on each other,if the Expired is destroyed then the Food also destroyed and vice versa.
  
  3.Expired and Toy
  
  Expired and Toy have an composition relationship.Both of them are highly dependent 
  on each other,if the Expired is destroyed then the Toy also destroyed and vice versa.

  4.Expired and Medicine
  
  Expired and Medicine have an composition relationship.Both of them are highly 
  dependent on each other,if the Expired is destroyed then the Medicine also destroyed 
  and vice versa.

  5.Expired and Other
  
  Expired and Other have an composition relationship.Both of them are highly dependent 
  on each other,if the Expired is destroyed then the Other also destroyed and vice versa.
  
##### Inherritance

 1.Item,Food,Toy,Medicine,Other
 
Inheritance among Food,Toy,Medicine and Other is representing an is-a relationship, where Item,Food,Toy,Medicine and Other is a type of Item. Inheritance is used because it allows  to reuse common attributes and methods defined in the Item class while also specifying their unique characteristics during instantiation.
