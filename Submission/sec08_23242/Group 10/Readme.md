## Description
In today's competitive retail environment, efficient inventory management is crucial for the success of any business, including pet supply stores. Our project aims to develop a comprehensive pet inventory management system designed to streamline and automate the operations of pet supply stores. By leveraging technology to track products, manage supplier information, and provide timely alerts for low stock items, this system will enable shop owners to maintain optimal inventory levels, reduce operating costs, and increase customer satisfaction. The ultimate goal is to help pet businesses thrive by simplifying daily operations and delivering valuable data to support informed decision-making.
