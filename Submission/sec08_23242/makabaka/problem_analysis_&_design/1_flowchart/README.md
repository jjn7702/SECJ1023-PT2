The flowchart above depicts the main processes in our proposed system. In the main flowchart, the system will be asking users whether they have existing accounts in the system. If they do, they will be directed to the login page (user will be required to enter username/email and password), while customers without a prior account will be requested to register as a user (user has to enter personal details such as username, email, password, phone number and other information). 
Next, the system will display a list of options. There are 4 options for users to select, which are update profile, explore book listing, update owned book and review book. If a user enters any key that is not in the list, the system will display a thank you message and end the program. ‘Press any key to return’ will work for every main process. 
In the process of profile updating, the system will display the user's profile. Users can choose which details to be updated, some of the details include username, password, and address. In the process of exploring book listing, users are free to choose from the given book listing in the beginning, or they can search for their desired book by entering 0. The details of the book will be displayed after the user selects the book ID. Users can choose to send a request to borrow the book if it's available or add it to the wishlist if it's unavailable. In the process of updating owned books, the system will display a list of user's books (that are uploaded before) . Users can select the book by entering the book ID to update the details of the selected book. Users can also add and remove books from their owned book list. In the process of reviewing a book, the record of the user's past book exchange will be displayed. Users can select the book by entering the selected book ID to enter a comment on that book.
