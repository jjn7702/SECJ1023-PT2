### :bulb: Synopsis & General Idea
> ***General Idea:*** <br>
> In an effort to share knowledge and promote resource availability for students and for people who struggle to gain access to professional readings and materials, a reference book exchange system emerged as a solution to many students’ and the interested public. It has the potential to become a beacon for in depth intellectual exchange. Unlike libraries where people are required to pay for a membership fee or obtain a certain identity status (such as students of a university) to gain access, the reference book exchange system we proposed allows access to all. Everyone is allowed to register as a user on our platform to be a loaner, a borrower, or even both! In this system, the chance of sharing professional knowledge is the same for everyone. Through this system, users can gain access to a multitude of information covering every subject without even needing to pay a penny! This platform promotes knowledge exchange and information sharing, thus will not cost users any money to utilize the platform. 
<br>

> ***Synopsis:*** <br>
> As mentioned above, our proposed reference book exchange system allows users to be a loaner and/or a borrower of reference materials. Users are free to explore the plentiful academic resources available on the platform and initiate their learning journeys according to their own pace. With reference books and professional readings within arm’s reach, our system will optimize their learning process without needing them to spend as much as they would if they choose to purchase all the desired materials at full price. In our system, users will go through different processes and be able to utilize different functionalities, such as exploring book listings, requesting book exchange, completing their user profile and more! Through these functionalities, we hope to create a system that students and learners would appreciate as a major source of information and knowledge.

### :mega: How To Use The System
First time users will be directed to the **sign up page**. Users will be requested to enter their email address then create their password. After successfully signing up, users will be directed to the **login page** and requested to login with the credentials provided to the system at the signup page.
After entering the system, users can either choose to go to their **account page** and update their recent information, **explore the book listing** currently available for exchange, or **update their owned book listing**. 

Firstly, updating users’ account pages would include the information of the user's current education level, user’s age, and user’s current education institution. On the other hand, if a user is interested in exploring books available for exchange, they will need to type in the book title into the search engine. If the title of the book is unclear, a ***keyword search*** can be done by only searching keywords of the book, then the system will produce a listing of relevant books. Users can further narrow down their search by applying a filter that includes but not limit to its date of publication, its author, edition number and ISBN code. Lastly, for users who wish to share their owned-books listing, they would be requested to type in information about the books. 

If a user decided a book was needed after finding it in the available book listing, the user could ***send an exchange reques*** to the book owner. After the book owner accepts the request, the book will be sent on its way. If out of a large amount of demands, the book owner received multiple requests for the same book, then the book owner will have to pick the earliest request and accept it whilst also rejecting the other requests at the same time. The book owner could also put them on hold if the book requesters would still like to be lent that book after a long wait.

### :chart_with_downwards_trend: Reporting & Output
<body>
<p>
The functionality of our system's reporting and output features is pivotal in fostering user interactions and ensuring a smooth exchange process. Upon registration and login, users are directed to their account pages where they can update personal information such as education level, age, and institution. 

Furthermore, users can utilize the search engine to browse book listings by titles or keywords. The system generates a comprehensive list of relevant books, allowing users to refine their search using filters like publication date, author, edition number, and ISBN code. Additionally, users can contribute to the platform by sharing their owned book listings, providing details about books they're willing to exchange. When users identify a desired book, they can initiate an exchange request with the book owner. 

The system facilitates communication between users and provides real-time notifications about the status of their requests. In instances of multiple requests for the same book, the system automatically prioritizes and processes requests based on submission time, ensuring fair and efficient exchange. Through these reporting and output features, our system aims to streamline the exchange process, foster collaboration among users, and enhance the overall user experience.
