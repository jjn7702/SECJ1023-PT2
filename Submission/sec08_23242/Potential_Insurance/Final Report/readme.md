# Introduction
The restaurant recommendation system is a software application designed to suggest 
restaurants to users based on their preferences, incorporating a blend of user feedback. The 
application collects data using a rating system and is developed using the C++ programming 
language.
The main aim of this application is to propose food options tailored to users' tastes and 
habits. Additionally, the application provides convenience for users to order food from their 
favourite restaurants.

# Objectives üóíÔ∏è 
‚Ä¢ Propose food options tailored to users' tastes and habits. <br>
‚Ä¢ Allow users to evaluate restaurants. <br>
‚Ä¢ Arrange restaurant details efficiently. <br>
‚Ä¢ Deliver precise restaurant details to users. <br>
‚Ä¢ Offer personalised dining suggestions. <br>
‚Ä¢ Enhance user contentment and involvement. <br> <br>

# Background of the project
In today's fast-paced world, finding a good restaurant that matches one's culinary 
preferences and geographical convenience can be a challenge. While existing platforms like 
Google Maps offer ratings, they often fall short in providing comprehensive information such 
as detailed menus. On the other hand, services like Foodpanda focus on food delivery, yet they 
frequently lack essential information about the restaurant's physical address and other relevant 
details, creating a gap in the user experience.
To address this gap, our project aims to develop a robust restaurant recommendation 
system that provides users with an integrated solution. This system will combine detailed 
restaurant information, including menus, user ratings, and precise locations. By leveraging data 
from multiple sources and employing advanced algorithms, we intend to offer personalized 
recommendations that cater to individual tastes and preferences.
Ultimately, our goal is to simplify the decision-making process for users when selecting 
a dining venue. By offering a comprehensive view of available options, we hope to enhance 
the dining experience, making it easier for people to discover and enjoy new culinary delights 
in their vicinity

# Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the 
data into a single unit, known as a class. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data.

# Composition
Composition is a design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects of other 
classes, implying a "has-a" relationship.

# Aggregation
Aggregation is a specialized form of composition where the lifetime of the contained objects 
does not depend on the lifetime of the container object, implying a "part-of" relationship but 
with independent lifetimes.

# Inheritance 
Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (child class) is derived from an existing class 
(parent class). The child class inherits attributes and methods from the parent class and can also have additional attributes and methods.

# Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common 
superclass. It is often used to perform a single action in different ways.

# Conclusion
In this project, we have gained valuable insights and practical experience in software 
development and team collaboration. We successfully implemented key C++ concepts such 
as association, composition, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and array of objects, 
which significantly enhanced our understanding of object-oriented programming and design 
principles. This hands-on experience allowed us to apply theoretical knowledge to a realworld problem, reinforcing our learning and boosting our technical proficiency.
Moreover, we have experienced the dynamics of working in a team to develop a 
comprehensive program. Through effective communication and collaboration, we managed 
to integrate our individual contributions into a cohesive system, demonstrating the 
importance of teamwork in achieving complex project goals. This process also taught us how 
to troubleshoot and resolve errors efficiently, utilizing various resources to overcome 
challenges and improve our problem-solving skills.
We hope that our restaurant recommendation system will provide users with a 
convenient and reliable tool to discover their desired dining options, ultimately enhancing 
their overall dining experience. Through this project, we have not only developed a useful 
application but also grown as programmers and collaborators, preparing us for future 
endeavors in the field of software development.
